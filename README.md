# truelayer-signing
Convenient libraries to produce TrueLayer API requests signatures.

Request signatures are created using a private key and included with certain API requests.
They can then be verified using the associated public key.

* [Rust](./rust)
* [C#](./csharp)
* [Node.js](./nodejs)
* [Go](./go)
* [Java](./java)
* [Java 7](./java7)
* [PHP](./php)
* [Python](./python)

## Request signing specification
See [request-signing-v2.md](./request-signing-v2.md) for an explanation of how request signing is implemented.

## Webhook signature verification
TrueLayer webhooks include a `Tl-Signature` header similar to request signatures but signed by a TrueLayer private key.
See per-language examples on how to properly verify webhooks.
