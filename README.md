# truelayer-signing
Convenient libraries to produce TrueLayer API requests signatures.

Request signatures are created using a private key and included with certain API requests.
They can then be verified using the associated public key.

* [Rust](./rust)
* [C#](./csharp)
* [Node.js](./nodejs)
* [Go](./go)
* [Java](./java)
